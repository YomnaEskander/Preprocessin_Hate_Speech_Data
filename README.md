# Preprocessing Hate Speech dataset.

I have used several NLP techniques to load, clean and preprocess the kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usharengaraju/dynamically-generated-hate-speech-dataset for a text classification task, where a BERT model is trained on the preprocessed dataset to classify text as hate or no hate.
